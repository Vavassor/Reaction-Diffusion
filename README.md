Reaction-Diffusion
==================

A moving art tool that forms natural and organic designs that can be painted and manipulated. It's based on a simulation of the Gray Scott model of [reaction-diffusion systems](https://www.karlsims.com/rd.html).

Features
--------

* **Flow mapping** - Applies flow to the solution based on solving the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluid.
* **Orientation mapping** - Influence the direction of diffusion at each point using a vector field.
* **Style mapping** - Vary the simulation parameters across the canvas to mix growth patterns.
* **Ink** - Add dye to the solution.
* **Import Images** - Import image files to use as any of the maps.
